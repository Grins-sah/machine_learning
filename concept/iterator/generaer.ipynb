      "A domain name is the web address people type into a browser to reach a site. Like a fingerprint, each domain name is unique to its website. Domains were created to make it easier for people to access websites without needing to remember IP addresses. For example, when you type \"google.com\" instead of a bunch of random numbers. Domains are structured with labels separated by dots, making them easy to read and share.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An IP address is just a series of four numbers between 0 to 255 separated by periods. While computers love these number sequences, humans do much better with words we can remember. That’s where domain names come in–they’re the shortcut that lets us remember sites like “google.com” instead of a bunch of numbers.

      "\n",
      "A lot of people use the terms domain name and Universal Resource Locator (URL) interchangeably, but there’s actually a bit of a difference. A domain name is just one part of a URL. Think of it as the main part of the web address that includes two main elements: the name itself and the extension. For example, in “google.com,” “Google” is the name and “.com” is the top-level domain. But when you look at your browser’s address bar, you’ll see more than just that–it’s made up of several parts of a URL working together to form the full URL.\n",

      "The internet is a global network of computers connected by submarine cables, with each computer having an IP address to send and retrieve data. Domain names are easier-to-remember versions of these IP addresses, like saving a friend’s number under their name in your phone. The domain name system (DNS) acts as the internet’s phone book, translating domain names into numeric IP addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When you type a domain name in your browser, DNS servers find the matching IP address and send your request to the “name servers,” managed by your web hosting provider. The name servers connect to the web server hosting the site, and the data is sent back to your browser—all in seconds.\n",

      "\n",
      "Generic top-level domains (gTLD): Commonly known simply as gTLDs, generic top-level domains are made of three or more characters and are open for registration by anyone. gTLDs account for the vast majority of domain extension options, with more than a thousand added in recent years through ICANN’s new gTLDs program. Available options range from the traditional .org vs. .com and .net to newer options such as .biz, .llc, .tips, .store, .co, .photos, .love, .work, .space, .digital, .club, .tv, .blog, .info, .site, .land, .company, .solutions, .website, .tech, .training, .coach, .world, .party, .yoga, .wiki, .ninja, .directory, .guru, .live, .fit, .studio, .today, .design, .pictures, .expert, .technology, .top, .co.uk .london, .tokyo, .ninja, .email and .xyz. Learn more about what .net is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD): These are more niche and managed by specific organizations. To register an sTLDA, you usually need to meet certain criteria related to a community or theme. If your website caters to a specific group, an sTLD can help establish credibility and trust right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Country code top-level domains (ccTLD): There are 308 country code top-level domains, each of which is identified by a unique, two-letter string. While country code top-level domains were originally intended for business and individuals operating in specific geographical areas, there is also a significant number of website owners who register ccTLDs for branding purposes or to take advantage of certain benefits. This is the case with extensions such as .ai (Anguilla), which is particularly popular within companies in the artificial intelligence industry, and .gg (Bailiwick of Guernsey), which has seen a significant popularity rise in the gaming sphere. Other ccTLD include: .de (Germany), .nl (Netherlands), .at (Austria), .mx (Mexico), .me (Montenegro), .ch (Switzerland), .br (Brazil) .be (Belgium), .fr (France), .in (India) and .ca (Canada).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, the SLD can also show the type of website in a region. For example, commercial websites in Spain may be registered with the domain extension .com.es whereas in the UK they appear as .co.uk. Likewise, in these same countries academic institutions may be registered under .edu.es and .ac.uk respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "Protecting your domain name is important to keep your website safe. Here are some simple tips to help you secure your domain:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose a reputable domain registrar: Pick a domain registrar known for solid security and great customer service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Use a strong password: Create a password that’s at least 12 characters long with a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding 2FA means you’ll need to enter a code from your phone when logging in, giving you an extra layer of protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep your contact information updated: Make sure your contact information with your domain registrar is up to date. This will help them to contact you if there is any suspicious activity on your account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch out for phishing emails: Phishing emails are designed to trick you into revealing your personal information, such as your domain registrar account password. Be careful about clicking on links in emails, even if they appear to be from legitimate sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep your domain registration information private: Domain privacy is critical. Don't share your domain registration information with anyone you don't trust. This includes your domain registrar account password, your domain name and your contact information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Plan ahead by purchasing your domain name\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re looking to buy a domain or just curious, you’ve likely realized how important domain names are. The US domain name industry is an 8.1 billion-dollar market that’s still growing, including the lucrative business of domain trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you register a domain, it’s yours—so long as you renew it annually or within your registrar’s time frame. This makes it crucial to secure the domain name for any business you start. It can be simple, like your name, or highly marketable, like business.com, which sold for $345 million. This practice, known as domain parking, often aims at domain flipping, and it’s more common than you might think.\n",
