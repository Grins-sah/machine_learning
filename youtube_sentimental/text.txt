The directory would be the album name year etc . Then before the extension (.mp3) we would type the group who copied the album to share. Also adding the bitrate of the files and a log. That was the scene, and it’s still here today on private trackers. This is what I remember doing in my teens sharing music online with others on irc. Running a file sharing server for music on irc, using irc script. We go for higher bitrates. No real player g2 style bs or wmv bs. Too much compression. This is before Napster and torrents. Just like you say quality over quantity. \n\nSource: me, data hoarder, file sharing enthusiast.\n\nLet’s not forget when Metallica threw a bitch fit over file sharing. Meh. They became memes that we’d used to see if you r browser had adobe flash. Lmfao. \n\nMetallica eventually had to change their mind and that’s good.
